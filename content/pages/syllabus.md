Administrative Details

### Grading

This is a pass/fail course — attend the classes, do the homework. Attendance is important; email us in advance if you have to miss a class.

### Optional Assignment(s)

There is an optional assignment that you can work on when you have free time, e.g. if you finish the class lab period early. This assignment is completely optional — it was designed to give you a better intuition for programming and to help in later course 6 studies.

### Textbook

This class uses readings from the online textbook _How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_ — it's always nice to have two perspectives on concepts. You can find this textbook [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkCSpy/).

Python Installation
-------------------

You can get the latest version [here](http://www.python.org/).

*   Linux and Mac OS X users: You should already have Python installed — to test this, run the command _Python_ in console mode. Note that the first line tells you the version number; you may want to upgrade your installation if you have a version earlier than 2.3.
*   Windows users: Grab the Windows installer from the Downloads section. After installation, you can run the IDLE _(Python GUI)_ command from the Start menu.
